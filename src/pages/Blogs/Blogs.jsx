                    What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?

                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>An access token and a refresh token are both used in authentication and authorization systems. Here is an overview of what they are and how they work:

                        Access Token:
                        It is typically issued by an authentication server or an authorization server after a user successfully authenticates and authorizes access.

                        Refresh Token:
                        A refresh token is a credential that is used to obtain a new access token once the current access token expires. It is typically issued alongside the access token and has a longer lifespan than the access token.</p>

                    Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?

                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>Differences between SQL and NoSQL are:
                        SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational.
                        SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
                        SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
                        SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
                        SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.</p>
